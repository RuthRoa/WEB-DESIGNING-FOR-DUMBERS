  For a while there, it was rough
  But lately, I've been doin' better
  Than the last four cold Decembers, I recall
 

  And I see my family every month
  I found a girl my parents love
  She'll come and stay the night
  And I think I might have it all
 

  And I thank God every day
  For the girl he sent my way
  But I know the things he gives me
  He can take away
  

  And I hold you every night
  That's a feeling I wanna get used to
  But there's no man as terrified
  As the man who stands to lose you
 

  Oh, I hope I don't lose you
  Mmm
  

  Please stay
  I want you, I need you, oh God
  Don't take
  These beautiful things that I've got
  

  Please stay
  I want you, I need you, oh God
  Don't take
  These beautiful things that I've got
  Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh
  

  Please don't take
 
  I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane
  It's been a while, but I'm finding my faith
  If everything's good and it's great
  Why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?
  Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
 
 
 I've got peace and I've got love
  But I'm up at night thinkin'
  I just might lose it all
  
  Please stay
  
  I want you, I need you, oh God
  Don't take
  These beautiful things that I've got
  Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh

  Please stay
  I want you, I need you, oh God
  I need
  These beautiful things that I've got
